close_project

Description: 
Close current opened project

Syntax: 
close_project  [-delete] [-quiet] [-verbose]

Usage: 
  Name        Description
  -----------------------
  [-delete]   Delete the project from disk also
  [-quiet]    Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]  Suspend message limits during command execution

Categories: 
Project

Description:

  Closes the current open project.

  Note: Any user-defined Tcl variables that are in the global namespace (i.e.
  not in a project-specific namespace) are not reset or cleared by this
  command. Global variables are persistent with the invocation of Vivado and
  are only cleared when the Vivado Design Suite is closed. You can also use
  the unset command to expressly clear a specific Tcl variable.

Arguments:

  -delete - (Optional) Delete the project data from the hard disk after
  closing the project.

  Note: Use this argument with caution. You will not be prompted to confirm
  the deletion of project data.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command closes the active project:

    close_project 
    

  This example closes the current project. If you have multiple projects
  open, the close_project command applies to the current project which can be
  defined with the current_project command.

  The following example sets project_1 as the current project, and then
  closes the project and deletes it from the computer hard disk:

    current_project project_1  
    close_project -delete 
    

  Note: Use the -delete argument with caution. You will not be prompted to
  confirm the deletion of project data.

ERROR: [DRC NSTD-1] Unspecified I/O Standard: 10 out of 10 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].

INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/home/ict/pr_led/pr_project/Sources/xdc/top_io_interwiser.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/shift_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/shift_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
